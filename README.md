# Choose Your Adventure - The Long Lost Treasure
Pirate Game

**(MS interactive-front-end project - Code Institute by Ángel González)**

This is a "chose your own adventure" type of game. The game is both available to be played in browser of portable device. The site itself includes some optional access features like light/dark mode, sound effects and ambient music to personalise user experience.

## UX
### User stories
Users of this WebApp will be people wanting to spend a good while playing through the game story and trying to beat it.

The site [(see full-size preview)](/assets/images/screencaptures/Full-page-browser.png) is based on a single interactive page. The sections are distributed symmetrically to make it intuitive to visually navigate through content in a fast and easy way.

Both the fonts and the optional ambient music are heavy pirate themed to make the experience more immersive for the user.

The user finds the game screen in the center of the window [(see full-size preview)](/assets/images/screencaptures/Full-page-browser.png) making it easier to focus on it.

Users also find the deployable card containing the "instructions" displayed by default, making it easy to understand how the game works in the browser.

Finally, the users have access to a deployable card containing some "options" to customize the experience both visually and audibly. [(see Features)](#Features)

### Strategy
The goal is that the user has a good time playing fluidly through the game. To achieve this, the design is clean and theme deeply defined. Also, some customize options are given to the user.

Is another of the goals that the player plays again after failing, so an option to "restart" is given right after losing. [(see Features)](#Features)

The most ambitious goal is having a player playing again after winning the game, to attempt to achieve this four different endings were defined.

### Wireframes
Here are the first concept wireframes:

* Browser View:

* Device View:

* Scene Types:

![Scene-type-speech](/assets/wireframes/Scene-type-speech.png "Scene type speech") 
![Scene-type-combat](/assets/wireframes/Scene-type-combat.png "Scene type combat")

Final concept wirerames:

* Device View:

Another very important part of the planning process was the structure of the story, this was in order to make easier establish code logic. Here are the decision trees of the game (last two are not included to avoid spoilers):

* Start decision tree:

* Hide decision tree:

* Enlist decision tree:

* Rob decision tree:

### Scope
Considering the goals set at [Strategy](#Strategy), has been necessary to make a solid pirate theme [(see Theming)](#Theming) to make the experience coherent. As well as giving some options to customize and make the user spend more time in the WebApp.

Also, was important to have all the interaction focus on the game screen to be able to use the project in portable devices.

### Structure
In the browser, all three main elements are occupying one third width of the screen:

![Full-page-browser](/assets/images/screencaptures/Full-page-browser.png "Browser View")

The **title** section, displays to the left and centered.

The **game** section, displays centered, focusing attention.

The **features** section, displays to the right with the instructions tab opened by default.

On a mobile device, all three main elements are aligned one on top of the other:

![Full-page-phone](/assets/images/screencaptures/Full-page-phone.png "Phone View")

The **title** section, displays on the top with reduced size.

The **game** section, displays centered and occupying most of the screen focusing attention.

The **features** section, displays under the main screen, given that this view is more intuitive and no space wants to be taken from the game section.

### Theming
As mentioned, theming was an important matter for the project in order to make the experience unique.

The special and more elaborated font for the title is [Jack Pirate](https://www.fontspace.com/jack-pirate-font-f42234) by [Måns Grebäck](https://www.fontspace.com/m%C3%A5ns-greb%C3%A4ck). The font for the rest of the site is "Pirata One".

All the pictures and desings were made on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

Color palette sticks to tones that are commonly associated with the pirate world.

Finally, the music used for ambience is [The Buccaneers Haul by Shane Ivers](https://www.silvermansound.com), meanwhile the button effect was found at [Sound Snap](https://www.soundsnap.com/).
