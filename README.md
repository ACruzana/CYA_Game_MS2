# Choose Your Adventure - The Long Lost Treasure
Pirate Game

**(MS interactive-front-end project - Code Institute by Ángel González)**

This is a "chose your own adventure" type of game. The game is both available to be played in browser of portable device. The site itself includes some optional access features like light/dark mode, sound effects and ambient music to personalise user experience.

## UX
### User stories
Users of this WebApp will be people wanting to spend a good while playing throught the game story and trying to beat it.

The site [(see preview)](/assets/images/screencaptures/Full-page-browser.png) is based on a single interactive page. The sections are distributed simetrically to make it intuitive to visually navigate through content in a fast and easy way.

Both the fonts and the optional ambient music are heavy pirate themed to make the experience more inmersive for the user.

The user finds the game screen in the center of the window [(see preview)](/assets/images/screencaptures/Full-page-browser.png) making it easier to focus on it.

Users also find the deployable card containing the "instructions" displayed by default, making it easy to understand how the game works in the browser.

Finally, the users have access to a deployable card containing some "options" to customize the experience both visually and audibly. [(see Features)](#Features)

### Strategy
The goal is that the user has a good time playing fuildly through the game. To achieve this the design is clean and theme defined. Also customize options are given to the user.

Is another goal also that the player plays again after failing so an option to "restart" is given right after losing.

The most ambicious goal is having a player playing again after winning the game, to attempt to achieve this four different endings were defined.

### Scope
Considering the goals set at [Strategy](#Strategy) has been necessary to make a solid pirate theme to make the experience coherent. As well as giving some options to customize and make the user spend more time in the WebApp.

Also, was important to have all the interaction focus on the game screen to be able to use the project in portable devices.

### Structure
In the browser, all three main elements are occupying one third width of the screen:

![Full-page-browser](/assets/images/screencaptures/Full-page-browser.png =890x "Browser View")

The **title** section, displays to the left and centered.

The **game** section, displays centered focusing attention.

The **features** section, displays to the right with the instructions tab opened by default.

In a mobile device, all three main elements are aligned one in top of the other:

![Full-page-phone](/assets/images/screencaptures/Full-page-phone.png "Phone View")

The **title** section, displays on the top with reduced size.

The **game** section, displays centered and ocuppying most of the screen focusing attention.

The **features** section, displays under the main screen given that this view is more intuitive and no space want to be taken from the game section.

### Wireframes
Here are the first concept wireframes:

* Browser View:

* Device View:

* Scene Types:

Another very important part of the planning process was the structure of the story to make easier stablish code logic. Here are the decision trees of the game (last two are not included to avoid spoilers):

* Start tree:

* Hide tree:

* Enlist tree:

* Rob tree:
